# Claude Code Guidelines

## MCP Usage
Use MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers when needed for enhanced capabilities:
- Use the configured exa, hugging-face, and smithery-ai-github servers as appropriate
- Leverage MCP tools to extend functionality and access external data/services

## File Management
- Do not create new markdown (.md) files unless absolutely necessary
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Only create files when essential for achieving the goal

## Code Style
- Write pythonic, modular code
- Follow Python conventions and idioms
- Organize code into reusable, well-structured modules
- Use clear function and variable names that are self-documenting

## Formatting
- No emojis in documentation or code comments
- Keep responses concise and technical
- Use code blocks for code examples
